Oh dear! I told you to prepare for the night! Are you okay?
오 세상에! 밤을 대비하라고 했었잖아요! 괜찮나요?
Are you sure you don't need my help? I'm still quite young and strong!
제 도움이 필요없는게 확실한가요? 전 아직도 꽤 젊고 강한데요!
You again? Maybe you'd better stop creeping into my house.
또 당시인가요? 제 집에 기어 들어오는 건 그만하셨으면 좋겠어요.
Want some soup? You are looking sluggish.
수프 좀 드실래요? 허기져 보여요.
It's fine... I don't need to leave. It's so cozy here.
괜찮아요... 전 떠날 필요 없어요. 여긴 정말 아늑하네요. // ?
Don't forget to have breakfast, it's a healthy start to the day.
아침 먹는 것을 잊지 말도록 해요, 하루의 건강한 시작이에요.
What's the matter? Where is everyone?
무슨 문제인강? 모두 어디 있나요?
 . . . 
Hey! Is everyone alright?
저기요! 모두 괜찮은 게 맞나요?
It isn't safe to talk here, but... my house survived the attack.
여기서 말하는 건 위험하지만,... 제 집은 공격에서 살아남았어요.
Meet me there, and I'll tell you what happened.
거기서 봐요, 무슨 일이 있었는지 말해줄게요.
So what did you want to tell me?
그래서 제게 무슨 말을 하고 싶은 건가요?
I told them! I warned everyone that they were coming! Black, twisted creatures of the night. I had seen them before.
저가 말했어요! 전 모두에게 그들이 온다고 경고했었어요! 밤 중의 검고 꼬인 생물체요. 전에도 본 적 있었어요.

But nobody listened! They called me old, they called me... crazy.
Then, it happened! I awoke to a terrifying sound! The walls trembled, and everything came crashing down.
Let me guess... The creatures?
Yes! Black as soot, like nothing you've seen... with eyes that could pierce your soul. 
The citizens had dreamt about them in their sleep, but this dream was reality.
Nightmares, as they were called lately.
I have learnt one thing, and you must listen.
You must prepare for the night! That's when they come... It isn't safe.
The witch must know something; I have to find her.
Maybe The Old Man knows where she is.
What brings you here?
I need your help. I have to find The Witch.
The witch!? Oh dear!
Trust me... you'd best stay away from that one.
I found a clue about her... I can't just ignore it.
Is that so? Well, in that case...
I'll make a map so that you can find her.
In the meantime, I'm so cold... Could you perhaps bring some firewood?
Well, you definitely brought firewood...
But is this really enough to keep an old man warm on such long, cold winter nights?
Ok fine, fine. Here's a map showing you where you can find the witch.
But be careful!
She's quick, and she's cunning, more than any fox in this land.
What are you doing here? I'm not expecting company today.
I'm sorry to intrude, but...
Might you know what happened in the Snow Ville?
Hmph. Perhaps! But why should I help you?
I found this note. Seems we may have a common enemy.
What!? Let me see that...
It says you saw everything.
Fine, fine. Yes, I saw them, mindless monsters. They took everyone's icy hearts.
Where did they go? Can you help me find them?
Not so fast! First, I need a favour. There's an ancient scroll...
You can find it in snowless lands, close to the black obelisk.
Hurry along now, I'll help after you bring it here.
This has to be the obelisk!
Excellent! Give it to me!
But... what is it for?
With this, I can perform the ritual...
We'll find out where our little nightmare friends went.
One moment. Oh dear, this writing is so small...
Does this say snow or blow? Hmm. Aha!
Well... I need a Groh's egg. Should be simple enough.
Wait, a Groh!?
Yes, you know - Those small, mildly dangerous creatures, flapping their wings near our shores.
Don't look at me like that. It's just one little egg! Off you go...
Aha! See, wasn't that easy? Now, we can begin.
There we go. Thank you, little friend, but... you can go now.
Wait, what do you mean?
What about the nightmares?! I have to find my friends!
Oh, those nasty things? Frankly, I have no idea.
And thanks to you, they're no longer my problem...
This spell will keep them away from my home.
I'm not going anywhere!
After everything I did... You have to help me find them!
Oh for goodness sakes... cool it! I don't want you melting on my nice, clean floor.
You should look for the great slime. It has something of yours.
It won't be so hard to find...
Just look out for huge, sticky slime trails.
It should be pretty obvious once you find them. Good luck!
Ugh. This trail heads to the east.
Okay... this definitely leads to the north.
Gross! Looks like it headed west.
I think it went south.
It's not clear where this leads. I need to find another.
The slime must be nearby!
You rescued a peaceful citizen.
Hey! I'm so glad to see you! Thank you for saving me!
For this I'll even give you a discount in my shop!
You? Offering a discount?!
Is that really you, Joe? Are you feeling okay?
Hah! After all that just happened, I'm honestly not so sure.
But I already regret what I said.

Joe, do you know what happened here?
Why do you ask? You're going to do something crazy, aren't you?
I have to rescue the others.
That's so like you. I can't remember much, but I know some people who might...
In the meantime, can you help me out?
I had a large batch of specialty sweets headed here...
But, the caravan vanished out in the snowless lands.
They're pretty expensive, do you think you could try to find them?
Do you see this huuuuge candy?
Yes, this sort of candy is hard to find.
I really, really want one!
Oh! For me? Thank you thank you thank you!!!
Here you are! This is my favorite toy!
Take it. I want you to have it, really!
Greetings! I am Avguard, mighty hero of this land.
Remember my name, for it will become legendary!
Tell me, small one. What happened here?
I don't kno-
Ack! Never mind!
Not to worry... I shall figure out this mystery myself.
You'd better find a chronicler to write of my deeds. Move along, small fry.
Alas, you are too late! You missed the main performance.
You should have seen how they ran!
Almost dropped their bags! A-ha-ha!
Wait, they took the bags? Where did they go?
No idea, small fry. But their camp should be nearby.
Here, this should come in handy.
Just in case any of them are still around - wouldn't want that cute little head to be smashed under a club.
All right! I have to get back to Joe.
You found the sweets! Oh man, you're the best!
Did you find anything out?
I did. But it's not the best news, I'm afraid.
You'll have to find Todolf in the cave of Ringing Wind. Not the safest of journeys, my friend.
Never heard of this... Todolf. How will I know if I found him?
Look for a dwarf with a long, scruffy beard. You'll easily recognize him.
And I know this sounds crazy but, wrap up. You'll need to keep warm.
You see, the cave has a... unnatural chill to it.
It's too cold even for us to bear... so be careful.
Are you going to the cave? Come on! Keep up!
I'll put them in their place, and fast!
Try not to freeze in here, kid! A-ha-ha!
What do ya need, traveler?
Joe sent me here to find you.
Joe...
Hah! Now there's a name I haven't heard in a while.
That scallywag still owes me for my last shipment of candies!
Look kid, bring me some Chof wool.
Then we'll talk.
Ah, the wool - much obliged, little one. Now, listen closely...
The path ahead is far more dangerous than ya realise.
You want ya friend's icy hearts back, aye?
The creatures have been takin'em. Not sure what for, but it can't be good. 
I mean, take the ice Queen, Knigness. For centuries, this cave has been under her protection.
But even she couldn't resist the call to darkness!
She shut herself away in her chamber, and ya need to get to her.
But... how?
Hmm, it's a long shot, but...
There's a shaman who once talked nonsense; saying he found a secret path into her chambers.
But no one believed him, he's the kind to make up stories, ya see.
Still, if ya want to ask him, go wandering through the cave. He'll likely be gathering mushrooms.
M-m-m...
Hello!
M-m-m-m-m-m...
Hallo!
M-m-What?! Who are you?
Sorry to interrupt... but I heard you know a secret path into the Queen's chambers?
I know? Oh, yes, I know!
I can even take you there.
But, first we'll need supplies!
I need a brilling cap, or two... no, make it five.
Wait, no! Ten! Even better!
Yes, ten caps and I'll help you.
Oh, it's you! Did you bring them? We'll need those caps.
Yes, here you are.
Ten? But I only needed five! Regardless, I shall now open a portal for you...
A portal? How is a portal a secret path!?
Well, you see, I mustn't give away all my secrets.
All right! Let's do this!
Enter the circle! And wait until the portal opens.
M-m-m-m-m... M-m-m... M-m-m-m...
Hurry, hurry! Into the portal!
U-ha-ha-ha!
Now then, what do we have here? Hmm?
I was wondering how to get our friend to make a portal. You saved me the hassle!
Now that we don't need him, I'll serve him up as a snack!
A-a-a!
You just sit here and wait. I'll fell Knigness myself, as the true hero of this land.
Since you're stuck here, why don't you start writing my great deeds?
A-ha-ha-ha!
No... no! How could I lose... impossible!
Another dares to disturb me? Then you shall be punished too!
I wish I could say, but talking won't help.
Such insolence! Death is your only saving grace... DIE!

I got the forge back up and running, so just ask if you need anything!
Actually, I could use your help, if you don't mind...
I was going to make rare sword's hilts.
But I'll need Tantalum. What little I had is gone, stolen no doubt.
Still, there should be plenty left in Oil Valleys. Could you..?
Sounds easy enough...
Great! Send me a sample of Tantalum. Oh! And you'll need to use a mechanical owl.
A what??
Go to Iron Ville, the folk there will tell you all about it.
I have to send Roland a sample of Tantalum.
To use owl module [OW-19] - First pour oil into the upper compartment.
Then put the item you wish to send in the lower compartment.
I think Roland will be pleased.
Welcome to Iron Ville.
Our humble village has guests so rarely.
What brings you here to us today?
I'm here at my friend's request.
What happened here? Wasn't this village flourishing?
These Markans continue with unlawful raids on our peaceful village.
They rob our homes, and our warehouses. They took all of our spare parts.
Now we cannot repair ourselves, or our homes. We are turning to rust.
Is there anything I can do to help?
We would definitely not refuse your offer of assistance.
If you could return some parts from the Markans, we would be most grateful.
Thank you! Finally, we'll be able to repair everything.
What do the Markans want with all those spare parts anyway?
I heard that in the main Markans camp there were many boilers.
It is likely that they will smelt the metal and create weapons.
Weapons?! I have to move fast!
I am Markhan, chief of all Markans.
Tell me your name, traveler? Tell me... why are you killing my brothers?
My name won't tell you anything, and your men are robbing the villages around!
Why are you involved in this? You look like you're from far-away lands.
That doesn't matter! Because of you, Iron Ville is rusting to pieces...
Soon the village will be gone.
You're killing them all... I can't let you do this!
It's not my fault! I am in no need of these hunks of metal that you call "spare parts".
I take orders from an Ancient Machine.
Otherwise terrible death is the fate of my people.
Let me go and I will stop the Ancient Machine!
You?! Ha-ha-ha!
Your fists... will never reach him.
I defeated Ice Queen Knigness, in the Cave of Ringing Wind!
Hmm...
I think there is no difference whether you die here or trying to kill the Ancient Mahine.
Well... if you destroy this sinister machine, so be it, I revoke my brothers.
Creature! Halt your assault!
You must not destroy this unit! The plant will become unstable!
You're bluffing, what could possibly happen?
This unit's security systems will go on full alert, releasing deadly toxins for miles around.
This unit was malfunctioning due to disrepair of my side panels.
Your last attack re-aligned the module, and this unit is now stable.
Allow this unit to live and it will never bother you.

Things are going according to the plan, but the Witch saw everything! Find her and kill.
Joe's shop... totally destroyed.
Roland used to make good swords, hope he is all right.
Farm... I've never seen it so quiet in here.
The only house to survive. I'm this way.
Meow
Oh no!
My darlings! My favorite!
Where are they?
What happened?
Someone stole my favorite pigs.
I bet it were those filthy green skin goblins
I fed the pigs, I raised the pigs, and they were stolen.
They also broke the fence! I don't even close the gate.
Was it necessary to break the fence?
Help me! Please give me back my pigs!
How are things there, did you find them?
I was late, when I came they had already roasted them at the fire.
Look here.
Molly!!!
I'm sorry.
It's she, she was the only one that chubby!
What about Lily?
They ate it.
Ravenous bums!
How could they raise their hand to these little pigs...
Well, now what should I cook for dinner?
. . .
Dinner?
I'm waiting for an old friend of mine today.
I wanted to prepare two portions of excellent pork according to my old recipe.
Well, I'll take what I can get.
Never mind. I have half of the work done at least.
Now I do not have to cook, right?
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

By the way, thanks for your help.
Here you are, take these rings in gratitude.
Fight, scum!

Greetings my friend! It's a long time nobody stopped by to say hello.
Tell me pls if you have time to help me?
My circular saw went bad last time.
And I left the lubricating oil at home.
Local slimes remain first-class mucus that I use as oil, could you get some for me?
I could do it myself but I threw out my back picking up some heavy things.
Going anywhere in such a condition is not making me happy.
I need about 10 units of mucus.
Well done! Thanks for helping me, oil is quite of a good quality.
If not you I think I would die.
I also have a surprise for you.
With it you'll be able to choose the toy you need for your further adventures.
And also take this wooden toy, I made it myself.
Hey! Are you okay?
Thank goodness. I must have done everything right.
Ugh, where am I? I don't feel so good...
Careful! Try not to move.
Where am I?
You are in Sunglade.
And who are... Wait, what are you?!
I'm talking to a tree?
Hey!
Who are you calling a tree!? That's the thanks I get for rescuing you?
Sorry I didn't mean to hurt you.
*Sigh* My name is Ashley, I'm a Dendroid.
A Dendroid?
A "living tree" as you so kindly pointed out.
I already said I'm sorry.
Tee-hee! Just kidding.
Anyway, you're from Snowville aren't you?
How did you know?!
My grandma told me of your kind. She said you're made of frozen water! Is that true?
Yes. And the word you're looking for is "snow".
Cool!
Are you feeling better?
Much. Thanks to you.
I'm glad. But, I have to get back. You should come visit us, we're just in a village nearby.
Okay, I'll have to drop by!
Ran away!
So, Ashley was not lying, you are really from Snowville.
I have not met any of you for such a long time!
Go faster to the house, or you melt away.
Please, make yourself at home. We have air conditioning, so hopefully it's cold enough.
Thanks. This is perfect.
You're most welcome. Say, I heard what happened in your village...
...
*Sigh*. An old wreck... He better not be hurt.
If you mean who I think you mean, he's fine. Still full of his usual tales.
That's not his tales, he steals everything from me!
So he is one you're very familiar with?
Oh! You should have seen us rocking in our time.
I still remember. Those poor chickens. And poor Joe! Hah!
Now this I have to hear.
See, Joe's father had this hole in his sweet-shop's roof. Cheapskate never did fix it.
And?
Let's just say... the hole was chicken sized.
Oh! You didn't!?
We did! They ate all his supplies. And they pooped everywhere!
Ha ha!
It reeked! You could smell it a mile away!
That's terrible!
Joe got over it, eventually. Anyway, I heard you've had quite the adventure yourself...
Nightmares wanted to get rid of me. Thank goodness Ashley showed up.
She's a good kid. So, what are you planning on doing next?
I have to get to the nightmare camp somehow.
I just wish I knew where to look.
There are legends...
Of Nightmares living in the abyss!
And the way to the abyss lies through the island of the damned.
Where Death itself is running everything.
And you won't meet another living soul there!
That could be it! How would I get there?
Hah! Like I'd know. I just know the legend, I'm afraid.
Before you go, would you help Ashley out? She wants to cook us a delicious stew.
As my grandma would say "I'm not going to do anything on an empty stomach"
By the way, that's for you. Here, take this.
What is it?
It'll show you how to make your own air conditioning unit.
Have you helped Ashley yet? The girl did save you, after all.
Oh, hi again! Did grandma send you?
She always thinks that I can not manage myself.
Well. Since you're here, you might as well help me.
I'd be glad to!
Let's split the work 50-50.
Bring me 10 carrots and a bunch of bananas.
I've been waiting for you for half a day! Where are you?
I hope you did not go to steal bananas from Aborigines?
You could have gotten them from the village storage.
I'm waiting back at home. Ashley.
Where have you both been all this time?
Do you want me to starve to death?
You're slower than molasses in January!
Granny, don't swear, we have guests.
Let's eat already
Thank you so much, it was delicious.
Now I definitely have enough power to find the island of the damned.
The Island of Damned?
So why don't you ask captain Edward, "the Wooden Leg"
He always boasted that he was there.
Oh, I almost forgot about him. Such a little braggart!
Oh Granny, you're just as bad!
Well, behind his tall tales there could be some truth.
You should see if he knows how to get to that island of yours.
It's worth a try. Thank you!
Leaving so soon? Maybe you'll stay here?
To me...
I'm sorry, but I really need to go.
But, I'll come visit sometime.
Ahoy there!
Is that a... snowman? Well, shiver me timbers!
Very funny.
I have to get to the Island of The Damned.
A wretched place! Have ye lost yer mind!?
Granny told me you'd help...
*sigh*... There be a way. But, my ship, she's seen better days
Hmm, she looks okay to me.
Aye, she looks good from here!
But in the last voyage, her mast took a nasty blow.
Damn merchants, since when do they put up a fight...
Merchants? Wait, are you a pirate?!
No way! I'm just an honest sailor!
Just had a, uh, disagreement with someone a long time ago.
Uhuh, Sure...
Anyway, that's the least of our worries!
If you want to get to that isle
we be havin' more than a mast to fix.
We'll need to restore old Bertha!
Bertha?
My secret weapon, Hah!
I'm not sure building a wea-
You're pretty high strung for someone made of ice, aren't ye?
Bertha's an engine. But she gets too hot, too easy.
Last time I used her, almost set fire to the ship she did.
HAH! Haha! Good times!
I'm not sure this is a great idea...
Be that as it may, we're gonna need more than sails to get where you're going.
*sigh* Okay, then. What do you need?
We need somethin' colder than cold.
Just so happens I've heard of a giant glacier in the Southwestern part of SunGlade.
And can ye even imagine? A giant glacier, in Sun Glade!
I'm... literally made of ice.
Hah! Touche!
Look, something is stopping that glacier from melting.
And whatever it is, we be needing it!
For Bertha, right?
Now ye get it! We keep her cool, we'll get to your isle.
And more importantly,
Ye get to sail with the legendary captain, Edward The Wooden Leg!
A-ha-ha-ha!
Fine, I'll go check it out.
Okay! I'll just... wet my whistle in the meantime.
My old friend! Did you survive in those caves?
Barely. But, what happened to you?
I was so frightened, that... that thing, attacked me with its huge sword!
I ran and I ran, and somehow, I ended up here.
I was so angry at you, because of you I had to leave my home.
I'm sorry...
Don't be! Things have worked out nicely. Nicely indeed!
Don't you see? These creatures worship me! I'm their king!
Uh...
It's s-so cold, so cold, thanks to the crystal.
And my drinks are always chilled!
*glug-glug-glug*
Ah! So, my snowy friend, what brings you here?
I need to find the source of the cold that supports these glaciers.
Do these glaciers hinder somebody? Nobody complained!
You said something about a crystal?
A crystal? What? No, I never. There's no crystal. No!
I just need to see it, maybe it can stop our engine from-
Enough! Stop talking!
What!? Wait, I only wanted-
I said silence! Listening to you almost got me killed,
and here you are again, trying to destroy my new life!
Those creatures, why are they coming so close...
Kill him!!!
You fiend! You hurt my friends!
Can you -just- listen for a minute?
FINE! Then speak!
If I don't take this crystal, the whole world could perish.
But my drinks! My icy cool drinks!
Where should I find that much ice?
Can't you ask your little friends to bring you some ice from other glaciers?
Oh. Oh! Of course!
Then fine, I suppose. Take it, take it.
I mean, we could have done this without fighting.
Don't make me change my mind!
Yo ho-ho-Hic! Weeeell
~I sat alone in the bar feeling sober and riled~
~When a big-chested gal sat beside me and smiled~
~Her eyes, her hair, my Heart began pounding~
~By the time the drinks came I felt close to drowning~
~Buuut, that's when I ran straight outta luck~
~She said I'd to choose, a beer or a -~
Ahem.
Snowboy! Man! -Hic-
I have something we can use to cool Bertha.
Ha! You little scallywag! -hic-
Did ye get the energy as well?
The what?
Oh, did I forget to mention it? We need fuel.
Eats a special kind of energy, Bertha does.
*Sigh* Fine, where can I find this so-called energy?
They have them at GoldVine park.
Cubes of energy, used to charge their lanterns.
I'm sure they won't mind ye -hic- "borrowing" one.
Why ye still here! -Hic!- Go find me a cube!
Looks like this is blocked by some kind of living vine.
Maybe Ashley can help...
Oh, hello! I wasn't sure I'd see you again.
How are things going? Did the Captain help?
Kind of. I need to get into the GoldVine Park.
But the path is blocked by some kind of giant vine.
Let us meet there tomorrow, I'll help you with it.
Today I'm too busy, I'm afraid...
Can I ask you one more question?
Why is the Captain called the "Wooden Leg"?
Um, isn't it obvious? He has a wooden leg.
Well ok, but you are made entirely of wood.
Do you think you can nail any stick to us
and it will be a part of us?!
Sorry, sorry, I know nothing about you...
First you have the audacity to call us trees, and now this!
You're lucky I like you, otherwise I'd-
Okay, ok, I'm leaving...
I've never seen anything like this, at least, not at this scale...
But, let me try something anyway.
Bibady-babady-boom.
Wow! That was amazing!
Why, thank you!
Now, try not to become fertilizer for weeds!
Thanks, I'll try.
No seriously, don't die. I have so few friends out here...
What the hell... is that!?
Seems she's not very happy that I'm here.
Excellent, this is just what I need!
Hey, Edward! I got the cube!
Oh, my head. Oh, ow...
Can we go now?
Slow down! And... stop talking so loudly!
Phew! I made it!
Why are you in such a hurry? Did something happen?
No, I wanted to say goodbye to you and...
and to give you this.
It's our family necklace, It will protect you from the dark forces.
Don't ever take it off!
Thanks, but... where did you get it?
My grandmother gave it to me when I was just a child.
Then I... I can't take this. It's important
No, take it! Consider it a parting gift.
After all, we may never see each other again.
Well, thank you very much, Ashley!
ARRRR!!!!!! Now I'm better!
Son of a biscuit eater! I hate the morning after the night before.
Well, snowboy! You ready to batten down the hatches?
Yes, I'm ready!
Then it's All hands on deck! Let's fire Bertha up!
Goodbye Ashley, thank you and your grandma for everything.
I'll tell her! Take care of yourself... please.
What ye waiting for! Unsheathe your sword!
Hit 'em with the pointy end!
Send these scallywags straight to Davy Jones!
Land Ahoy!
Hope you're ready for this, kiddo...
Jonathan, I told you not to bother me anymore
the fact that you've been serving my Mother for that long
does not make you The King of this island.
Jonathan, I need some time alone
Don't breathe down my soul.
Soul... I have... Ha!
Jonathan, get the joke?
*Ahem*...
Hey! You are not Jonathan!
I never claimed to be...
Mortal?
Your kind is not welcome here.
Although, perhaps luck is on your side...
I'll refrain from taking your soul.
But only if you go find Jonathan!
You can explain why you're here afterwards.
Now go find him! He usually hangs out at the disco.
Disco?!
Yes. It's at the graveyard. Obviously.
Erm...
Your ticket, please.
Um... I think I left it at home.
Right, suuure you did. Just like that demon earlier.
That won't work twice with me!
Sir, there's a crow on your head!
Oh, is that so?
I guess that makes me a bird-brain, right? Hah!
Look, you seem like a decent kid.
Go on in. And make it quick before I change my mind.
Hopa, hopa, hopa-pa!
Isn't this music great?!
What!? I can't hear you!
Why aren't you dancing, come on!
The DJ is killing it tonight!
Hey! Wanna buy me a drink?
Phew! Working up a sweat here!
Jo... who? I can't hear you!
Jonathan?! Uh, right.
He and Lily went to the kissing spot...
No doubt they'll be making out there
And thanks for breaking the speakers, jerk!
I'm so glad that we made up.
mmHmm, me too.
Why are you smiling?
Oh, no reason...
You're lucky you're so cute.
Hehe! Say, how's Death doing?
He's in a rotten mood.
Wait. Someone's spying on us!
Sorry... Lily, right? And Jonathan?
Who wants to know?
I was actually sent here by Death.
He wants you to go meet him.
Is this some kind of joke?
First he sends me away, and now...
Ugh! I guess I have no choice.
Hey! Aren't you forgetting someone?
I won't let you go! You promised a whole evening of romance with me.
But... Lily, he's my friend!
It won't take long.
No! You promised! Sit back down!
Not even if I buy ice-cream on the way back?
Not even. You're all mine, remember?
Okay, then I'll visit him lately, let's hang out a while.
Only me and you, in this beautiful graveyard...
No, now I want an ice-cream!
Go and buy it!
I'll bring you an ice-cream and you let me go. It'll be fair.
You are the one who mentioned it first so blame yourself!
Let your new friend buy me an ice-cream, then you may go.
We don't even know who he is, why the hell he should go for your ice-cream?
Okay then I'm no longer talking to you...
Listen, could you go for an ice-cream?
With spiders on top!
Yes-yes, Ice-cream with spiders!
It's not far from here, just east of the graveyard.
Hello! See anything you'd like?
One ice-cream, please.
Any extras with that?
Add wriggling worms
Add glowing fireflies
Add icky spiders
Add chirping crickets
On second thoughts, I'll get back to you
That'll be ten nails, please.
Nails don't grow on trees, come back when you have some.
Here you are, your ice-cream!
Ew! There's no spiders! I can't eat this!
Oh! Now Jonathan you can go straight back to your Death!
Well, no offense, I'll be soon.
I'm not offended. Mmm, spiders...
Well, off I go. Death awaits.
Thanks for helping me with an ice-cream.
Oh, it's you...
I see you managed to defeat Knigness.
How the one who didn't even undergo combat training,
to become a great warrior
could manage to defeat her?
Nevermind, you needn't answer.
And actually, I owe you an apology.
Please understand there was never any malice in my actions.
You see, Avguard isn't even my real name.
I'm his brother. Wilgrid.
Avguard was once a mighty warrior.
Once, during a combat campaign,
I disobeyed him. And because of me, we were ambushed.
He protected me, shielding me with his own body
and unfortunately did not survive...
You know, before the campaign he told me
He wanted to become a legendary warrior...
He wanted his name to be known across the whole world
That's why I took his name, I... I had to.
I had to make his dreams a reality.
I don't know why I'm telling you this now.
Maybe it's because I've finally realized
He just wanted me to be happy, to live my own life.
I wish I'd figured it out sooner.
Wait, I can hear his voice... finally, I'll see him again...
Oh! And that's our new friend I told you about.
So it turns out that he is mortal, I didn't notice it firstly.
Now we can talk as I promised.
Tell me, why are you here, on this godforsaken island?
I was sent here to find something...
something or someone to help me get into the abyss.
...
This again? After all these years?
Wait, has this happened before?
It matters not. I know what it is you seek, young one.
I will help you, after we deal with a little problem...
do you see this magnificent sculpture behind me?
It is an effigy of my mother.
She left, and burdened me with her endless responsibilities
I do not have a minute to spare so long as I am in this... situation.
Maybe that's because you're so terrible at it!
Jonathan! You little-
What? It's the truth!
Well, I suppose things could be better...
Lately everyone here seems to hate me!
I'm pretty sure it's because of those newcomers,
spreading lies and deception.
You know, mother would never have stood for it.
To hell with it! I won't stand for this either.
I'll send you to the abyss, young one,
but only because I require your help.
Find out how and why this nonsense started.
First, take Jonathan and go find Big Sam
I want to know how they bribed him, of all people.
He should be near the wagon station.
In the meantime, I'll try to find the bastards who did this.
I tried to talk him, but he just keeps eating... and eating!
He won't answer, he only cares about food.
Did someone say "food"?! Where? Gimme!!
It turns out that everything is much easier than you thought.
You have lots of food, why you want more?
This is nothing! I'll be hungry again in an hour.
And I'm already hungry. Look! I lost weight!
This is all Death's fault, with his new laws!
Hold up, death didn't change any laws...
I know everything! They told me all about it.
They said that Death ordered the rails
by which I was delivered food on wagons to be taken apart!
I think we need to check what happened to the rails.
We are the servants of Death!
Wait, we are?
I do not believe myself that I am saying this...
The food was never cancelled. Your new friends lied!
What!? I'll tear them to pieces, and chow them down!
And if we fix the food supply?
Then consider that Death will have my full support!
That's right, we can just follow the tracks
and find out what happened.
Yesss! All this food, just for me!
Finally I can truly fill my belly.
Did it ever actually get empty?
I'll ignore that, you rascal!
Just so you know, the guys I talked to mentioned the ruins
They seem to think nobody would look for them there
That's all for now, time to chow!
Hmmm... old ruins, there were such nearby
I was wondering... why do the monsters attack us?
*CHOMP*
After all, some of them are in a good sense and don't seem to be aggressive, especially compared to you.
That's why this is the island of the damned, you'll get here and slowly
go mad, I would say very slowly, approximately
a couple of thousand years, until complete unconsciousness.
*CHOMP*
That does seem a little cruel but to say truth
A couple thousand years is a long time!
Anyway, let's go, hopefully we'll get lucky and find them.
Lily! What are you doing here?
What!? You told me to meet you!
Damn, it's a trap!
Somebody set us up.
Hmm, I did get the feeling we were being watched at the graveyard.
What? Why didn't you say so!?
Hah! You'd just say I had an overactive imagination.
We need to go back to Death, tell him about Big Sam.
Yeah... let's go.
Jonathan, take me home, I'm scared.
Just in case somebody's watching.
Okay, I walk Lily home, see you later.
There you are! What took you so long?
Well, we talked to Big Sam and fixed everything.
Now he owes you.
I suppose that's a start! Now, it's my turn to help...
The path to the abyss...
I forgot to mention this, but you see, the thing is
only the dead, or spirits of the dead...
can exist there.
Mortals cannot gain entry.
I can release your soul from its mortal coil
But are you really up to such a bold task?
Wrap your head around that...
In the meantime, we need a weapon that will help you.
You definitely cannot do anything with your weapon
to the darkness that you have to face.
Go to the sacred source, I've marked it on your map.
Dip your weapon into the source, and then return here.
Take this bottle!
Take the bottle!
Take it!
What's this?
It is filled with darkness.
It will absorb the source!
Absorb it all!
I don't want to!!
Why do it at all? Why do I need to do this !?
Silence!
You have already failed us once!
We used the portal!
The snowman should have melted!
Melted!
Make one more mistake...
It will be your last
Your last!
*sniff* I-I guess I have no choice...
*POP*
Ashley, stop!!
No! What are you doing here!? Go, before they-
You again?
You FOOL! You cannot stop us!
It is time...
Finally time, to use our portal
Portal!
What!?
Where did you get that Amulet!?
We are the only two
who have such a thing!
It was all her doing!
She stole it!...
For this
You'll die.
Die!
Ugh, that was too close...
Jonathan! That was awesome!
Let me... just catch my... breath
I'm so sorry! I didn't want to help them...
But I had to! Please believe me!
But, why?
They were going to destroy our village,
My grandmother wouldn't have survived it.
And they said such terrible things! I'm so sorry.
You know, if you hadn't given me this amulet,
I'd be dead. I owe you my life!
Now, we should get rid of what's in this flask.
Okay! Sure!
You, you...
Just know that It's really good to see you again.
After all this is over, will you visit me?
Sorry to disappoint, but there's no way he'll-
Yes of course!
I'll be sure to drop by!
...
...
It's time to go...
Grandma and I will be waiting. We'll prepare a feast for you!
You will no longer be mortal...
You will become one of them.
This is a one-way trip, there's no way back!
You ready?
Yes
No
I hope it goes better than last time...
That was so many years ago...
I'm home...
Was it just a nightmare?
Hey! Shopping again?
Today, as always, we have the freshest!
Um, are you okay? You look ill.
I... I don't know.
I guess I just had a really bad dream.
Happens, eat some sweets, it'll help!
I don't want to
I'm going to go and see the old man.
Listen...
You'd really sleep it off...
The old man died many years ago.
His house is barely even standing...
So you actually did it!
Finally it happened...
But how? They told me that you died many years ago...
Many years?
I did not even notice how quickly time passed.
Like it was yesterday...
I was defeated, but I was able to stop the darkness for a while
preventing it from escaping out of the abyss.
My good friend...
I can finally find peace, thanks to you.
Didn't you think that only one old man survived
when the whole village was destroyed?
Ahahaha!
It would be stupid!
Goodbye, my friend.
I'm glad I met you. Now, at long last... I can rest.
